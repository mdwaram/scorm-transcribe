<h3>Topic 1: Introduction</h3>

<p class="page">Welcome to Grace Hill's Assistance Animals and Accommodations</p>
<p>Consider the following example:</p>
<p>Lauren works for a community with a no-pets policy. An applicant asks if they&rsquo;ll make an exception for his service dog. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d really like to live here,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;But where I go, the dog goes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lauren isn&rsquo;t sure. The policy says &ldquo;No pets&rdquo; and she&rsquo;s afraid that allowing an animal would make other residents upset.</p>
<p>This situation shows why it&rsquo;s important for everyone in the multifamily industry to know about assistance animals.</p>
<p>Requests for assistance animals could come at any time. Even if you&rsquo;re not the person responsible for evaluating the requests, you have an important role to play. Your response to situations like these helps your community stay in compliance with fair housing law.</p>
<p>In this course, you&rsquo;ll learn how to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify common accommodations involving assistance animals.</li>
<li>Respond appropriately to accommodation requests for assistance animals.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Topic 2: Assistance Animals Basics</h3>

<p class="page">Under the Fair Housing Act and Section 504, people with <strong>disabilities</strong> have the right to an <strong>assistance animal</strong> as a <strong>reasonable accommodation</strong> in housing<strong>.</strong></p>
<p>For more information on laws regarding assistance animals and common terms, <a href="AssistanceAnimals_FactSheet_ENG_04042023.pdf" target="_blank">download our Assistance Animals Fact Sheet.</a></p>
<p><strong>Disability</strong></p>
<p>Having a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities; having a record of or being perceived as having such an impairment</p>
<p><strong>Assistance Animal</strong></p>
<p>An animal that does work, provides assistance, or performs tasks for a person with a disability.</p>
<p><strong>Reasonable Accommodation</strong></p>
<p>A&nbsp;change in any rule, policy, practice, or service so that a person with a disability has an equal opportunity to use and enjoy their home</p>

<p class="page">A reasonable accommodation is a change to any rule, policy, practice, or service.</p>
<p>There are many ways people might ask to make an exception for an assistance animal.</p>
<p><strong>No Pets</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;I know you said &lsquo;no pets,&rsquo; but you make exceptions for assistance animals, right?&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Weight Limits </strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;My dog&rsquo;s over 50 pounds but he&rsquo;s an emotional support animal.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Restricted Breeds</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;No pit bulls? She&rsquo;s a service dog!&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Cats and Dogs Only</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;Is my hedgehog allowed? He&rsquo;s an assistance animal.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="page">It can be difficult to tell if an animal is an assistance animal.</p>
<p>Assistance animals can be nearly any type of animal that&rsquo;s kept in a home. In very special circumstances, assistance animals can even be less common animals, like a miniature horse or monkey.</p>
<p>Assistance animals might be trained to perform a specific task, or they might have no special training at all.</p>
<p>They might be wearing a special collar or harness, but this isn&rsquo;t a requirement.</p>

<p class="page">Requests for assistance animals must be carefully evaluated.</p>
<p>A manager, corporate employee, or sometimes a supplier partner will evaluate requests for assistance animals using three criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>The person must have a disability.</li>
<li>The animal must serve a function directly related to the disability.</li>
<li>The request to have the animal must be reasonable.</li>
</ul>

<br>

<h3>Topic 3: Responding to Requests for Assistance Animals</h3>

<p class="page">If you&rsquo;re not the person evaluating requests for assistance animals, your role is to relay the request to the correct person.</p>
<p>The first step in responding to requests for assistance animals is to recognize the request.</p>
<p>This might seem obvious, but in practice it can be a little tricky. Let&rsquo;s look at a scenario to learn more.</p>

<p class="page">Lauren: So, Allen, what do you think? Are you ready to fill out an application today?</p>
<p>Allen: Honestly, yeah, I like it. There&rsquo;s just one thing&hellip;</p>
<p>Which of the following is Lauren&rsquo;s best response?</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
<li>Ask, &ldquo;Is this about the no-pets policy? Are you wanting an accommodation for your dog?&rdquo;</li>
<li>Say nothing.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Feedback:</strong> Your responsibility for accommodation requests begins when the person makes the request, or when their representative (like a family member or caretaker) makes a request for them. <strong>Don&rsquo;t try to anticipate someone&rsquo;s needs. </strong>Wait for them to make the request.</p>

<p class="page">Allen: I know you said pets aren&rsquo;t allowed, but obviously I have Sadie here.</p>
<p>Lauren: I see her; she looks very sweet.</p>
<p>Allen: Yup, she&rsquo;s the best. Thing is, I need her. She&rsquo;s my service dog. Is there a way around the no-pets rule?</p>
<p>Which of the following is Lauren&rsquo;s best response?</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
<li>Ask, &ldquo;How are you disabled?&rdquo;</li>
<li>Say nothing. Wait for Allen to officially ask for an accommodation.</li>
<li>Say, &ldquo;We make exceptions for assistance animals as required by law. Would you like to make a request?&rdquo;</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Feedback:</strong> The person making the request doesn&rsquo;t have to use specific terms. It&rsquo;s up to you to recognize what they&rsquo;re asking for even if they don&rsquo;t say the words &ldquo;assistance animal&rdquo; or &ldquo;accommodation.&rdquo; Never ask about their disability.</p>

<p class="page">Next, follow your company&rsquo;s policies and procedures. This most likely involves offering the person a form to fill out or directing them to a supplier partner&rsquo;s website to complete their application online.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at a scenario to see how this process may work.</p>

<p class="page">Allen: What do I have to do?</p>
<p>Lauren: I can give you our reasonable accommodation request form. It&rsquo;ll walk you through the process and what information we need.</p>
<p>Allen: What if I don&rsquo;t fill out the form?</p>
<p>Which of the following is Lauren&rsquo;s best response?</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
<li>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fill out what I can based on our conversation and give it to my manager.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;You have to complete the form to have your request evaluated.&rdquo;</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Feedback:</strong> You should ask customers to complete your reasonable accommodation request form. Keep in mind that you can&rsquo;t require a specific form. Every request must be evaluated, no matter how it&rsquo;s made. If someone doesn&rsquo;t want to fill out the form, you can use the form to document their verbal request and submit it to your manager.</p>

<p class="page">Last, when it comes to accommodation requests, communication is key. Keeping customers in the loop helps manage their expectations. If they&rsquo;re not sure what the next steps are, they might think they&rsquo;re being ignored.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at one last scenario to see this step in action.</p>

<p class="page">Allen: How long until I know if this is approved?</p>
<p>Lauren: That&rsquo;s a great question. I&rsquo;ll get your request to my manager today. They'll contact you if they need any other information and go over next steps in the process.</p>
<p>Allen: But what do <strong>you</strong> think? Is there a chance I can live here with Sadie?</p>
<p>Which of the following is Lauren&rsquo;s best response?</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
<li>Say, &ldquo;We have to go through the process, but I can tell you that we evaluate every request in a timely manner.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll get approved. It&rsquo;s pretty obvious Sadie is a trained service dog.&rdquo;</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Feedback:</strong> Even if a request seems reasonable to you, don&rsquo;t make promises. Just let the customer know that your community evaluates all requests and will keep them in the loop.</p>

<br>

<h3>Topic 4: Summary</h3>

<p class="page">Now that you&rsquo;ve completed the course, here are some key points:</p>
<ul>
<li>A person qualifies for an assistance animal as an accommodation if they have a disability, the animal serves a function related to the disability, and the request is reasonable.</li>
<li>Assistance animals can be nearly any kind of animal commonly kept in households. The term &ldquo;assistance animal&rdquo; includes emotional support animals, companion animals, and service animals.</li>
<li>Follow your company&rsquo;s policies and procedures to respond to accommodation requests.</li>
</ul>
