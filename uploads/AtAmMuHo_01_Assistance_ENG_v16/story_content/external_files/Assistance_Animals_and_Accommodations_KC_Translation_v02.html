  <p>A resident requests a reasonable accommodation for a cat that provides them with emotional support related to a documented disability. A coworker says, &ldquo;We have to deny this request because only dogs can be service animals.&rdquo; Which of the following is the best response to your coworker?</p>
  <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
    <li>You&rsquo;re right. We don&rsquo;t have to allow cats.</li>
    <li>You&rsquo;re right. We only have to make accommodations for service animals, not emotional support animals.</li>
    <li>That&rsquo;s not right. Cats can still be assistance animals; we need to consider the request.</li>
  </ol>

<div id="kc3">

<p>James is a prospective resident who uses a guide dog. It&rsquo;s clear that the dog is trained for this task and that James requires it. He requests an exception to your no-pets policy as a reasonable accommodation. What should you ask James in relation to this request?</p>
  <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
    <li>Ask for a doctor&rsquo;s note to verify James&rsquo;s disability.</li>
    <li>Ask James how long he&rsquo;s had the disability.</li>

<p>Paulo, a resident, asks leasing consultant Sheila what kinds of animals he&rsquo;s allowed to have in his apartment. When Sheila tells him that cats, dogs, and fish are permitted, he looks disappointed. &ldquo;My therapist thinks that I could really use a bird,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Is there anything you can do?&rdquo; Which of the following is Sheila&rsquo;s best response?</p>
  <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
    <li>Sheila can&rsquo;t do anything until Paulo specifically uses the words &ldquo;assistance animal&rdquo; and &ldquo;accommodation.&rdquo;</li>
    <li>Sheila can ask Paulo if he needs the bird as an accommodation for a disability.</li>
    <li>Sheila should ask Paulo for permission to call his therapist directly.</li>

<p>Which of the following is the best statement to include in a no pets-policy to help ensure that the policy isn&rsquo;t seen as discriminatory?</p>
  <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
    <li>We comply with all federal, state, and local laws regarding assistance animals.</li>
    <li>Out of fairness to residents with allergies, we don&rsquo;t allow animals in this community.</li>
    <li>We occasionally make exceptions for small, well-behaved emotional support dogs.</li>
    <li>If you have an animal, we can recommend some local pet-friendly communities.</li>

<p>Carlos tells his coworker, Walker, that he&rsquo;s going to suggest that a resident get an assistance animal. &ldquo;My mom struggles with the same kinds of things,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;It really helped her.&rdquo; What should Walker say to Carlos?</p>
  <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
    <li>&ldquo;If you think it would help, I think that&rsquo;s a great idea.&rdquo;</li>
    <li>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you should say anything. It&rsquo;s not good to make assumptions about what a resident might need.&rdquo;</li>
